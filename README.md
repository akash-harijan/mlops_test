## **Project Overview**
This project automates key steps of the ML lifecycle using the MNIST dataset:
1. **Model Training**: A pipeline trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the MNIST dataset.
2. **Model Validation**: The pipeline validates the trained model, computes evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy), and stores them in an SQLite database.
3. **Model Deployment**: A RESTful API is provided for online inference using the trained model.

This solution demonstrates best practices for machine learning operations (MLOps), including modular pipelines, model validation, and deployment.

## **Setup Instructions**

### 1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd mlops_test
```

### 2: Install Dependencies
Install the required Python libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3: Train the Model
Run the training pipeline to train a CNN on the MNIST dataset:

```bash
python -m pipeline.train
```
This step will:
- Train a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the MNIST dataset.
- Save the trained model to the file ```models/model.h5```.


### **Step 4: Validate the Model**
Evaluate the model using a validation dataset and store the metrics in SQLite:
```bash
python -m pipeline.validate
```

This step will:

- Compute validation loss and accuracy metrics.
- Store the metrics in the SQLite database ```metrics.db```.


### **Step 5: Run the API**
Start the FastAPI server to serve the model:
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

The API will:

- Be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.
- Provide predictions for online inference.

## **Docker Deployment**

### **Build the Docker Image**
To build the Docker image for the project, use the following command:
```bash
docker build -t mlops_test .
```

### **Run the Docker Container**
To run the Docker container, ensuring the API is accessible on your local machine, use the following command:
```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 mlops_test
```
This setup will make the API accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs, allowing you to interact with it through your local network.


## **Evaluation Metrics**

After running the validation pipeline (`validate.py`), the following metrics are computed and stored:

- **Validation Loss**
- **Validation Accuracy**

Metrics are saved in an SQLite database `metrics.db`, allowing for easy access and analysis of the model's performance.

## **Future Improvements**

1. **Model Registry**: Integrate with MLflow or another model registry for better model tracking and versioning.
2. **Cloud Deployment**: Deploy the API to AWS (Lambda or ECS), GCP (Cloud Run), or Azure Functions.
3. **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automate model training, validation, and deployment using GitHub Actions or Jenkins.
4. **Model Monitoring**: Add monitoring for live inference, including latency tracking and performance drift detection.
5. **Distributed Training**: Use distributed training for larger datasets to enhance performance and accuracy.

These improvements aim to enhance scalability, manageability, and the overall robustness of the MLOps workflow.
